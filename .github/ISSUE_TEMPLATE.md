## Does This Really Belong to GitHub issues?

If you find a bug you understand well, poor default, incorrect or unclear piece of documentation,
or missing feature, please [file an
issue](http://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny/issues) on GitHub.

Please use [Bunny's mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-amqp) for questions,
investigations, and discussions. GitHub issues should be used for specific, well understood, actionable
maintainers and contributors can work on.

When filing an issue, please specify

 * Which Bunny and RabbitMQ versions are used
 * Recent RabbitMQ log file contents
 * Full exception stack traces
 * Steps to reproduce or a failing test case

This would greatly help the maintainers help you.
